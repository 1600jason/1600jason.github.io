Hello, and welcome to my web page! My name is Jason and I am studying computer science at Cal State Fullerton.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

**Lab 6, part 2** was one of my favorites because along with learning and practicing how to code logic in a simple game, I learned basic rules of blackjack, which I’ve never played before. This lab helped me practice writing functions with if statements and command line arguments. A challenge for me was coding the part about counting the ace as 1 or 11.

**Lab 7, part 1** was perhaps my favorite lab because for me it provided a difficult but fun challenge. Some of the parking hours were sort of confusing, and having to code in which hours to include or exclude was challenging but in a fun way. In this lab I further familiarized myself with if statements and conditions.

**Lab 9, part 2** was also one of my favorites because I got to learn file input and output while creating a simple guessing game. I got more practice writing if statements, command line arguments, and simple logic. It elevated a very simple game by implementing file I/O, which is a concept that I liked learning.
